## Installation

Install is as easy as:

```bash
haxelib install utest
```

## Basic usage

In your main method define the minimal instances needed to run your tests.

```haxe
import utest.Runner;
import utest.ui.Report;

class TestAll {
  public static function main() {
    //the long way
    var runner = new Runner();
    runner.addCase(new TestCase1());
    runner.addCase(new TestCase2());
    Report.create(runner);
    runner.run();

    //the short way in case you don't need to handle any specifics
    utest.UTest.run([new TestCase1(), new TestCase2()]);
  }
}
```

`TestCase` must extend `utest.Test` or implement `utest.ITest`.

`TestCase` needs to follow some conventions:

  * Every test case method name must be prefixed with `test` or `spec`;
  * If a method is prefixed with `spec` it is treated as the specification test. Every boolean binary operation will be wrapped in `Assert.isTrue()`

Following methods could be implemented to setup or teardown:
```haxe
/**
 * This method is executed once before running the first test in the current class.
 * If it accepts an argument, it is treated as an asynchronous method.
 */
function setupClass():Void;
function setupClass(async:Async):Void;
/**
 * This method is executed before each test.
  * If it accepts an argument, it is treated as an asynchronous method.
 */
function setup():Void;
function setup(async:Async):Void;
/**
 * This method is executed after each test.
  * If it accepts an argument, it is treated as an asynchronous method.
 */
function teardown():Void;
function teardown(async:Async):Void;
/**
 * This method is executed once after the last test in the current class is finished.
  * If it accepts an argument, it is treated as an asynchronous method.
 */
function teardownClass():Void;
function teardownClass(async:Async):Void;
```

Default timeout for asynchronous methods is 250ms. You can change it by adding `@:timeout(500)` meta.

To add all test cases from `my.pack` package use `runner.addCases(my.pack)`. Any module found in `my.pack` is treated as a test case. That means each module should contain a class implementing `utest.ITest` and that class should have the same name as the module name.

```haxe
import utest.Assert;
import utest.Async;

class TestCase extends utest.Test {
  var field:String;

  //synchronous setup
  public function setup() {
    field = "some";
  }

  function testFieldIsSome() {
    Assert.equals("some", field);
  }

  function specField() {
    field.charAt(0) == 's';
    field.length > 3;
  }

  //asynchronous teardown
  @:timeout(700) //default timeout is 250ms
  public function teardown(async:Async) {
    field = null; // not really needed

    //simulate asynchronous teardown
    haxe.Timer.delay(
      function() {
        //resolve asynchronous action
        async.done();
      },
      500
    );
  }
}
```

## Inter-test dependencies

It is possible to define how tests depend on each other with `@:depends` meta:
```haxe
class TestCase extends utest.Test {

	function testBasicThing1() {
		//...
	}

	function testBasicThing2() {
		//...
	}


	@:depends(testBasicThing, testBasicThing2)
	function testComplexThing() {
		//...
	}
}
```
In this example `testComplexThing` will be executed only if `testBasicThing1` and `testBasicThing2` pass.

## Dependencies between test classes

`@:depends` meta could also be used to define dependencies of one class with tests on other classes with tests.
```haxe
package some.pack;

class TestCase1 extends utest.Test {
	function test1() {
		//...
	}
}

@:depends(some.pack.TestCase2)
class TestCase2 extends utest.Test {
	function test2() {
		//...
	}
}
```
In this example tests from `some.pack.TestCase2` will be executed only if there were no failures in `some.pack.TestCase1`.

## Running single test from a test suite.

Adding `-D UTEST_PATTERN=pattern` to the compilation flags makes UTest to run only tests which have names matching the `pattern`. The pattern could be a plain string or a regular expression without delimiters.

Another option is to add `UTEST_PATTERN` to the environment variables at compile time.

## Async tests

If a test case accepts an argument, that test case is treated as an asynchronous test.

```haxe
@:timeout(500) //change timeout (default: 250ms)
function testSomething(async:utest.Async) {
  // do your async goodness and remember to call `done()` at the end.
  haxe.Timer.delay(function() {
    Assert.isTrue(true); // put a sensible test here
    async.done();
  }, 50);
}
```

It's also possible to "branch" asynchronous tests. In this case a test will be considered completed when all branches are finished.

```haxe
function testSomething(async:utest.Async) {
  var branch = async.branch();
  haxe.Timer.delay(function() {
    Assert.isTrue(true); // put a sensible test here
    branch.done();
  }, 50);

  // or create an asynchronous branch with a callback
  async.branch(function(branch) {
    haxe.Timer.delay(function() {
      Assert.isTrue(true); // put a sensible test here
      branch.done();
    }, 50);
  });
}
```

## Print test names being executed

`-D UTEST_PRINT_TESTS` makes UTest print test names in the process of tests execution.
The output will look like this:
```
Running my.tests.TestAsync...
    testSetTimeout
    testTimeout
Running my.tests.TestAnother...
    testThis
    testThat
```
And after finishing all the tests UTest will print usual report.

Another option is to add `UTEST_PRINT_TESTS` to the environment variables at compile time.

## Convert failures into exceptions

It is possible to make UTest throw an unhandled exception instead of adding a failure to the report.

Enable this behavior with `-D UTEST_FAILURE_THROW`, or by adding `UTEST_FAILURE_THROW` to the environment variables at compile time.

In this case any exception or failure in test or setup methods will lead to a crash.
Instead of a test report you will see an unhandled exception message with the exception
stack trace (depending on a target platform).

## Reducing message detail

When `Assert.isTrue` or `Assert.isFalse` uses a comparison operator or function call, and no failure message is passed, utest runs a macro to generate one.

```haxe
  function testSum() {
    var x = 3;
    Assert.isTrue(2 + 2 == x + x); // Failed: 2 + 2 == x + x. Values: 4 == 6
    Assert.isTrue(2 + 3 >= x + x); // Failed: 2 + 3 >= x + x. Values: 5 >= 6

    var array = [1, 2, 4, 8];
    Assert.isTrue(array.contains(x)); // Failed: array.contains(x). Values: [1,2,4,8].contains(3)
  }
```

This macro can be disabled using `-D UTEST_FAILURE_REDUCE_DETAIL`, or by adding `UTEST_FAILURE_REDUCE_DETAIL` to the environment variables at compile time. Without the macro, utest falls back to a generic failure message.

```haxe
  function testSum() {
    var x = 3;
    Assert.isTrue(2 + 2 == x + x); // expected true
    Assert.isTrue(2 + 3 >= x + x); // expected true

    var array = [1, 2, 4, 8];
    Assert.isTrue(array.contains(x)); // expected true
  }
```

## Ignoring tests

You can easily ignore one of tests within specifying `@Ignored` meta.

```haxe
class TestCase extends utest.Test {

  @Ignored("Ignore this test")
  function testIgnoredWithReason() {}

  @Ignored
  function testIgnoredWithoutReason():Void {}
}

```
